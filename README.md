If your platform is unsupported or not listed above, there is still a chance you can run the release or manually build it by following the instructions below.

## Developing YouTube Player EX

### Prerequisites

Please make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- A desktop platform with the [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed.

When working with the codebase, we recommend using an IDE with intelligent code completion and syntax highlighting, such as the latest version of [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig) and [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) plugin installed.

### Downloading the source code

Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/BoomboxRapsody/YouTubePlayerEX
cd YouTubePlayerEX
```

To update the source code to the latest commit, run the following command inside the `YouTubePlayerEX` directory:

```shell
git pull --recurse-submodules
```

### Building

#### From an IDE

You should load the solution via one of the platform-specific `.slnf` files, rather than the main `.sln`. This will reduce dependencies and hide platforms that you don't care about. Valid `.slnf` files are:

- `YouTubePlayerEX.Desktop.slnf` (most common)

Run configurations for the recommended IDEs (listed above) are included. You should use the provided Build/Run functionality of your IDE to get things going. When testing or building new components, it's highly encouraged you use the `YouTube Player EX (Tests)` project/configuration. More information on this is provided [below](#contributing).

To build for mobile platforms, you will likely need to run `sudo dotnet workload restore` if you haven't done so previously.

#### From CLI

You can also build and run *YouTube Player EX* from the command-line with a single command:

```shell
dotnet run --project YouTubePlayerEX.Desktop
```

When running locally to do any kind of performance testing, make sure to add `-c Release` to the build command, as the overhead of running with the default `Debug` configuration can be large (especially when testing with local framework modifications as below).

If the build fails, try to restore NuGet packages with `dotnet restore`.

### Code analysis

Before committing your code, please run a code formatter. This can be achieved by running `dotnet format` in the command line, or using the `Format code` command in your IDE.

We have adopted some cross-platform, compiler integrated analyzers. They can provide warnings when you are editing, building inside IDE or from command line, as-if they are provided by the compiler itself.

JetBrains ReSharper InspectCode is also used for wider rule sets. You can run it from PowerShell with `.\InspectCode.ps1`. Alternatively, you can install ReSharper or use Rider to get inline support in your IDE of choice.
